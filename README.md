# DDL
ðŸŽ‰ Our paper `DDL: Effective and Comprehensible Interpretation Framework for Diverse Deepfake Detectors` has been accepted by **TIFS'25**! [[Paper Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10937201)]

Currently, we need additional time to organize the code and prepare instructions and documentation. The related code will be updated in this repository soon. Thank you for your attention to our work!

ðŸ’¦ Note: Since all the code development and organization work is currently being handled by me alone, and I am also in the process of organizing the open-source libraries for two other papers, along with a extremely busy schedule recently ðŸ˜­, I expect to complete the organization and updates by May 2025. Thank you again for your understanding!
